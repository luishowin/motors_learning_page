        <h1>SO HOW DO MOTORS WORK?</h1>
        <p>A simple DC (direct current) motor consists of a permanent magnet, a coil of wire, and a commutator. When electric current flows through the coil, it generates a magnetic field. The permanent magnet produces a fixed magnetic field. The interaction of these magnetic fields causes a torque on the coil, making it rotate. The direction of the current in the coil is constantly reversed by the commutator, which ensures that the torque is maintained in the same direction, resulting in continuous rotation. The speed of the motor is controlled by adjusting the voltage or the current supplied to the coil. By utilizing this basic principle, DC motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, making them widely used in various applications, from small appliances to industrial machinery.</p>
